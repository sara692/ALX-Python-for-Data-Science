# 📚 ALX Data Science Assignments

This repository contains my weekly assignments from the **ALX Data Science course**.  
Each folder corresponds to a project that focuses on a key aspect of Python for data science.  

The goal of this repository is to track my learning journey and build a portfolio of projects that demonstrate practical skills in data analysis, cleaning, and visualization.
